/**
 * <p>
 *  This class contains the algorithm for sorting objects which depend on one another in such a way that all objects
 *  which depend on others, are after the objects it depends on.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *  It is originally written for the RDO export page in which RDOs have to be exported after any RDOs which it depends
 *  on.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *  There are a number of optimizations, or changes to the interface which could be made to improve it, however for the
 *  data density and shape of the data (very few, and very short dependency chains) which we currently have, and that
 *  it is currently only used in one place.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *  Note: For future reference: If we find that there is a performance issue in the algorithm itself and wish to rewrite
 *  it, the name of this general problem is &quot;Topological Sorting&quot; of a &quot;Directed Acyclic Graph&quot;.
 *  We do have to account for cyclic graphs in this algorithm.
